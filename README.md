#### Hotbot version 6.0.2

#### What is hotbot? 
At a glance, Hotbot is a discord bot built specifically for a programming server. It has many features, including fun, administration, channel management, an internal permissions system as well as some forms of anti-spam. 



##### User manual
This is TBD, since currently the only user of it (really) is the creator of this project -- that being said there will be a full end to end manual done in readthedocs, github pages or something similar to accommodate for people who want to set up their own instance. Please note, hotbot at this moment in time is a **single** server bot, this means that you will get unexpected behaviour if you run it on more than one guild. Multi-guild may come in 6.x.x but for now it is a far away feature. 


##### Developer documentation
- This bot depends primarily on JDA, you can find a link to JDA [here](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) 
- In order to build the project, you will need maven installed. You can view more about maven [here](https://maven.apache.org/)
- Full documentation will be available later of the DSL's created and some of the other features seperated from the commands. Commands are   by in large self-documenting. 

More documentation to come!

##### Contributing

- Keep pull requests small and easily digestable, stick to one feature or one atomic change within the project.
- If you are going to submit a feature PR, make sure that you ask me if I want it in the bot first, since if I don't want it, it won't end   up in the bot, and you will have wasted your time (potentially, maybe you can still use it?)
- Try to keep commits somewhat atomic, if you need to make a feature which requires various changes to the code base, try to commit each     of these individually.
